I created a website that displays prayer times for Fajr, Dhuhr... for specific cities, such as Riyadh,Mecca...with a simple design
‏I used HTML and CSS to build and design the website; javascript to make the website dynamic, such as changing cities, and the axios library to fetch prayer times data based on the city.
